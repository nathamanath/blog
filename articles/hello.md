title: Hello world...
tldr: Im nathan, this is my blog
date: 2014-8-25

Hi I am Nathan Goddard Im 27 yeas old and am a programmer living in Surrey, UK.
I currently work at [Monochrome ltd](http://monochrome.co.uk), where I mainly
write Ruby on Rails applications. Outside of work I mostly play bass guitar,
run, brew beer, and hack on my own projects.

I enjoy hacking outside of work, I would not do this for a job if not. And I
feel that to get / stay good at this you have to do this.

This blog is going to focus on whatever programming I am currently enjoying.

So why start a blog? Because doing this work I am constantly learning, and I want to keep
learning fast. So by publishing what I have learned, I will then have to make
sure I actually understand what I am on about, else face the wrath of the internet.

Also I have very little of my own code I can show to people, so this will help to fix that.

I will aim to post something on here at least monthly, I will add a contact form
asap, and if people start reading this (yes I am watching you) I will add commenting.

So Ill write an article on something soon, but for now, here is [my github
page](https://github.com/nathamanath), and
[my codepen profile](http://codepen.io/nathamanath/) and come back soon :)
