title: Hello world...
tldr: Im Nathan, and this is my blog. Its new.
date: 2014-8-25

Hi I am Nathan Goddard Im 27 yeas old and am a programmer living in Surrey, UK.
I currently work at a near by web development agency, where I mainly write Ruby on
Rails applications for clients ranging from startups to corporates.
Outside of work I mostly play bass guitar, run, brew beer, and hack on my own projects.

So why start a blog? Because I enjoy coding, am constantly learning, and I want to keep
learning fast. So by publishing what I have learned, I will then have to make
sure I actually understand what I am on about, else face the wrath of the internet.
Also this could come in handy when I forget stuff.

I will aim to post something on here at least monthly, I will add a contact form
asap, and if people start reading this (yes I am watching you) I will add commenting.

So Ill write an article on something soon, but for now, here is [my github
page](https://github.com/nathamanath), and
[my codepen profile](http://codepen.io/nathamanath/) and come back soon :)
