title: Hello world...

Hi I am Nathan Goddard I'm 27 years old and am a web programmer living in Surrey, UK.
At work I mainly write Ruby on Rails and javascript applications for clients ranging from
startups to corporates. Outside of work I mostly play bass guitar, run, brew beer,
and hack on my own projects.

So why start a blog? Because I enjoy coding, am constantly learning, and I want to keep
on learning fast. So by publishing what I have learned, I will then have to make
sure I actually understand whatever it is I am talking about, else face the wrath of the internet.
Also this could come in handy when I forget stuff.

I will aim to post something on here at least once a month, and I will add a contact form
asap. Also if people start reading this, I will add commenting too.

So I will get on and write an article on something soon, but for now, here is
[my github](https://github.com/nathamanath), and
[my codepen profile](http://codepen.io/nathamanath/) and come back soon :)
